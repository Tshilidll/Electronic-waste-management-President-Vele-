E-Waste Management Website Project
Welcome to the E-Waste Management Platform! This project aims to raise awareness, educate, and provide resources for managing electronic waste (e-waste) responsibly. E-waste management is crucial for reducing environmental impact, preventing hazardous waste from reaching landfills, and promoting a circular economy by reusing valuable materials.

Project Overview
Goal: To create a user-friendly platform where users can learn about e-waste, find resources for recycling or safely disposing of electronics, and connect with certified e-waste management companies.

Main Features:

Education Center: Provides information on the environmental impact of e-waste and tips for sustainable technology use.
Recycling Locator: Helps users find nearby certified e-waste recycling centers or pickup services.
Donation and Disposal Options: Lists options for donating functioning electronics to charitable organizations or disposing of them responsibly.
Community Forum: Allows users to share ideas, advice, and experiences on sustainable technology practices.
User Dashboard: Allows users to track their e-waste contributions and learn how to reduce personal electronic waste.
Why E-Waste Management?
E-waste includes discarded electronic devices like computers, smartphones, appliances, and batteries, which often contain hazardous materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium. Improper disposal can lead to environmental pollution and health risks. Recycling or repurposing these items helps conserve resources, reduce pollution, and support sustainable development.# Electronic-waste-management-President-Vele-
